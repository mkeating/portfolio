content: Pulp was my capstone design project for my master's degree. It started out as a classroom tool, but evolved into just a general game-app for encouraging creative writing by allowing users to influence and inspire each other. Users can create branching, choice-based stories much like the Choose Your Own Adventure books you probably read as a kid. The branches can be either explicit (a button that says "Enter the cave", for instance) or more implicit or impressionistic; each word of the active text can become its own branch. In an effort to make the collaborative nature feel more real, Pulp updates in real time, so if you and another user are on the same panel, you can see any links they create as soon as it happens.
tools: Meteor.js
