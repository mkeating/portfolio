content: <a href="https://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html"> This</a> is a database of information on all those executed in the state of Texas. Ghosts of Texas is a Twitter bot I made in Python that scrapes this site and tweets their last words. This is not intended to be humorous or political; I just found it to be a really compelling body of text.
tools: Python, Twitter API
