content: Poetwee is an app that lets you build a poem out of tweets. Supply a line of poetry (or any multi-word phrase), and Poetwee will return 10 tweets for each word that includes that word. You can then swipe back and forth to select which tweet you want to use for each line in your new poem. Your original phrase becomes the "spine" of the resulting poem.
tools: PHP, JQuery, Twitter API
