Requests for feedback:

* General thoughts on UI and how navigation feels and could be improved. If possible, try it out on phones or tablets, and with another person - Pulp updates in realtime, so if your friend branches off from a panel you're reading, you should see the new choice pop up under "children." Does this happen fast enough? Any conflicts?
* How do you want the site to refer to you? Username, first name, email? Are these the same or different from the way you want to log in? Do you want to have an avatar? Is it important that you know who wrote what panel, or is the story itself more important?
* I'm thinking of introducing some features like randomly generated prompts to get people started, and small, meaningless rewards for "good writing" (this will be hard to define, but a simple one would be to recognize alliteration and just have a little "good job!" animation or similar). Do you think this would be valuable? Do you have suggestions for other similar functionality?
