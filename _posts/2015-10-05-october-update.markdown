Areas for feedback: 

* What is your opinion on removing the form for all but the active panel? Should a user only be able to branch from their current active panel, or be able to scroll back up and start off in a new direction?
 
* Are there other types of data that I should be capturing in the panels object? I'm considering things like votes/comments, but I'm thinking they will take away more than they add. 

* Same question above but for users. I plan to add a bookmarks functionality that saves panels currently being read. Other possibilities include ratings, stats about their writing, etc.
